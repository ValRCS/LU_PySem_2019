# Course Project

 During the course, students are required to complete a project that accomplishes a non-trivial programming / data processing task using Python tools. 

## Possible project topics: 

* Process, analyze, and/or visualize a dataset. 
* Small game
* Web site
* other

Data sets can come from a variety of sources, such as kaggle.com, data.gov.lv, or faculty. 

All processing and visualization will have to be done in the Python programming language with the appropriate Pyhon libraries.

 You can use libraries covered in the course or/and from outside the course.

Other topics may also be selected with prior agreement with the faculty. 


Projects can be submitted in teams of 2-3 people. 

## Project Description Presentation

On 15.11.2019 students should present project description in class.

* The idea
* Rough idea on libraries/tools needed
* What a successful outcome should be

## Final Project Presentation

Project presentation 08.01.2020 @ 10:00 (auditorium TBD)

 Project presentation = 5-10 min. presentation consisting of:

* Introduction (what the work is about) 
* Project realization (what was programmed, what software was used) 
* Demonstrations of results 

You have to show what the project has done in practice = show code and results. 

Each group should send an email to uldis.bojars (at) lu.lv containing: 

* job description (including list of group members)
* Developed source code (or its URL at Github,Gitlab etc)
* Job results (eg Jupyter notebook)
