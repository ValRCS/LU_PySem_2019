You could do the same in R using, for example, the `dplyr` package. I'll also necessarily delve into _groupby_ objects, wich are not the most intuitive objects. The process of split-apply-combine with _groupby_ objects is a pattern that we all perform intuitively, as we'll see, but it took took Hadley Wickham to formalize the procedure in 2011 with his paper _The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis_.\n",
